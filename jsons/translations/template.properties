### - General Changes to make - ###
# The following list are items that the mod changes it's name trough all the translations. Have them always in mind!
# When you see "Read as:", means that you have to translate THAT, instead of the line under

#          No Ancient Ruins = No Crash Sites ( <- in your language)
# NOT:     Read as: No Crash Sites
#          No Ancient Ruins = No Ancient Ruins ( <- in your language)

Connecting your cities to the capital by roads\n  will generate gold via the trade route.\nNote that each road costs 1 gold Maintenance per turn, and each Railroad costs 2 gold,\n  so it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow! = 

You have encountered a barbarian unit!\nBarbarians attack everyone indiscriminately, so don't let your \n  civilian units go near them, and be careful of your scout! = 
  # Read as: Units can only gain up to 50 XP from Xeno units - meaning up to 4 promotions. After that, Xeno units will provide no experience.
Units can only gain up to 30 XP from Barbarian units - meaning up to 2 promotions. After that, Barbarian units will provide no experience. =

Keep generating ☮Faith, and eventually a great prophet will be born in one of your cities. =

One of these great prophets can then be used to enhance your religion. = One of these great visionaries can then be used to enhance your religion.
Spreading religion happens naturally, but can be sped up using missionaries or great prophets. = 
Missionaries can be bought in cities following a major religion, and will take the religion of that city. = 
So do take care where you are buying them! If another civilization has converted one of your cities to their religion, missionaries bought there will follow their religion. =

But do take care, missionaries will lose 250 religious strength each turn they end while in foreign lands. = 

Lastly, before founding a religion, new cities you settle will start with 200 pressure for your pantheon. =

Proof that there were alien civilizations that predate ours, this labyrinthine complex of ruins keeps depicting symbols pointing towards the constellation Aurigae. = 
A truly gigantic form of sedentary life, its sap holds rejuvenating properties to any life imbibing it. Speculations ensue over whether this organism is natural, or were genetically engineered in the past. = 
An entire mountain suspended on air, initial scans show the presence of a sizable Ulframite and Gravitix deposit under it. It has been theorized that its antigravitic properties are a side effect of a natural Ulframite reactor, although this is debatable. = 
Only a small part of this gargantuan alien ship is poking above water. Initial scans indicate that the rest of the ship is lodged inside an undersea trench, preserving whatever valuable artifacts in its depths. However, there would be a booming artifact market if this wreck is within reach of civilization. = 
This vast body of water is composed of one humongous single-celled organism. Ingesting its gelatinous liquid causes intense hallucinations, and many believers come in pilgrimage. = 

# Resources:

Underground growths of plantlike xenoflora, they are quite edible if prepared correctly. = 
While fungal xeno-organisms flourish in this planet, most of them are toxic or disagree with our biochemistry. Some of them, however, possess fruiting bodies that are both edible and tasty. = 
There are few non-fungal plantlike xeno-organisms, and most do not grow fruits like these. Quite tasty if harvested in the right season. = 
Hardy extremophiles living in the hottest of deserts and the coldest of tundras, these stone-like xenoflora can be the sole source of nutrient in these places. = 
Most of the mobile xenofauna in this planet seem to be linked by a primitive hivemind and are hostile to us. Among the docile few, these beetle-like xenofauna possess a chitinous carapace which it sheds regularly - and provide us with building materials. = 
One of the few docile xenofauna in this planet, large herds of these aphid-like bugs graze on the alien grass and excrete globs of nutritious liquid, which is edible for humans. It is said to taste like liquid cheese. = 
Not to be confused with an obscure old Earth explosive, these are iron ores which naturally form a hexagonal lattice due to other elements in its molecule. This also means that they are easy to smelt into steel. = 
A good, solid rock, these stones with volcanic origins are good building material. = 
The deserts of this planet sometimes have sands composed of very pure silica - one of the materials needed for a good-quality lens. = 
Far more plentiful here than on Earth, this durable yet lightweight metal is perfect for vehicles, aerial or otherwise. = 
A naturally occurring compound in this planet, it can easily be processed into an efficient fertilizer. = 
These reddish metal ore possess above average conductivity when processed into wires. Scientists suspect they come from another reality. = 
Deep ocean hydrothermal vents are not only good sources of heat, they are also the source of exotic compounds and xeno-organisms. = 
Microbial plantlife floating in the sea, they exhibit striking similarities to the algae of old Earth. This means they, too, can be a source of nutrient and biofuel. = 
Gossamer threads grown naturally by seafloor xenoflora, these can fetch a high price on local markets, since local colonists use them for textiles. Also, they are tasty when fried. = 
Free-floating microscopic xenofauna and xenoflora, these are an excellent source of nutrients and biofuel. = 
One of the few watery xenofauna that agrees with our biochemistry, these are plentiful enough at sea to be a regular source of meals. = 
A kind of hypersaline ice caused by polar currents and microbial agents, they possess unique physical attributes that researchers love to study. = 
Some type of moss or fungal xenoflora, these hardy organisms can enhance the taste of food. But prepared in a different way, and they become a potent hallucinogenic. = 
Certain substances from local xenoflora and xenofauna can energize a tired mind and/or body, when prepared carefully. =
