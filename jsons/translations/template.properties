Connecting your cities to the capital by roads\n  will generate gold via the trade route.\nNote that each road costs 1 gold Maintenance per turn, and each Railroad costs 2 gold,\n  so it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow! =

# Natural Wonders:

These huge interconnected mass of organic matter were impressive on their own - but what's more astonishing, the ecosystem here is more akin to a neural network. Scientists compete to learn what they can from these reefs.
A silent tomb for a creature so huge its existence violates the square-cube law, scientists swarm to find the secrets of its origin. Builders, however, rejoice at the ample construction materials.
A fungal miracle, no less than eight different ecosystems can be found inhabiting this humongous mushroom.
Proof that there were alien civilizations that predate ours, this labyrinthine complex of ruins keeps depicting symbols pointing towards the constellation Aurigae.

This vast body of water is composed of one humongous single-celled organism. Ingesting its gelatinous liquid causes intense hallucinations, and many believers come in pilgrimage.
